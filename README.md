The title of "Face Verification on Labeled Faces in the Wild using Different Mini Batch Mining Strategies" 



#Quick summary of my project 

The aim of this project is to train a given Neural network with different popular Mini batch mining strategies.

    For this purpose we have chosen the task of Face verification.



I have used 10% of the whole FaceNet data for training and we have used Labeled faces in the wild image data for verification of each data.



I have done 5 experiments as part of this project. 

In this project I have used three popular mining strategies and a 2 default sampling techniques which constructs the mini batch with random sampling.

The random sampling method is implemented to make comparisons against other mining strategies.

The three popular mining strategies that I have used here are Pairwise mining, Triplet mining and Doppelganger Mining.


The Triplet Mining gives the best results(~93%), when compare to Pairwise(~90%) and Doppelganger Mining(~90%).
